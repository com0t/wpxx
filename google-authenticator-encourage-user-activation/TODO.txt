* add a video to explain 2fa, for users who prefer that. try to find one that uses the wp GA plugin as example, otherwise might confuse a bit. if can't, look for one that's abstract
* Find a better term than "nag", since that has sexist connotations. Maybe "warn"?

* Internationalize
* Move settings to its own screen, cause new users won't think to look on the General screen
* Don't allow admin to enable Force mode if they don't have 2FA enabled, because they'd lock themselves out
* Redirecting to profile when in force mode isn't working anymore, instead see a wp_die() error. Not a big deal since user will only see it from bookmarks, etc, but should still fix
